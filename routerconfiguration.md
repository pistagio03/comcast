Prologue
Part 1
--[Urban Legends].
That was one of the [Desires] of which the amount almost numbered the
expanse of stars in the sky.
--For example the Urban Legend that 'No Human has really ever stepped
foot on the moon'.
--For example the conspiracy of the Freemasons in the American dollar bills.
--For example the time-space experiment that took place in Philadelphia.
The Chiyoda Line’s nuclear shelter, Area 51, the Roswell UFO incident, etc.
After seeing this many examples, it can be concluded that there is always
some kind of distinct pattern between them. That pattern is a...'It would be
interesting if it was real' kind of [Desire].
Smoke will not rise without fire as its source. However as it spreads and
builds up, that [Desire] becomes a [Rumor].
This kind of thinking was not strange to the world. Since ancient times,
Humans have always preferred the [Inevitable] to an [Accident], after all. The
birth of mankind was likely the accidental product of astronomical probability.
According to the humans, there was something that intentionally wanted to
create humans.
Looking from this way of thinking, the world was not chaotic, but more
orderly. By imagining out a reason behind the meaning of existence, to help
explore the vagaries and ruthless values of this world.
..........People lived with this desire in their hearts. Therefore, [Urban
Legends] can also be said to be something that was born from earnest
[Desire].
—Then. On this planet where there were enough [Urban Legends] to
illuminate the skies, there were examples of it being obviously the truth, yet
still being treated as an urban legend. In the end, nobody knows if they were
real.
—Don't be mistaken, this does not mean that the aforementioned urban
legends are true.
Only the reason behind the existence of these urban legends are somewhat
different from rumors.
Now then, how did this [Urban Legend] come about? It started as any
ordinary [Rumor]. But it became a rumor that was so unrealistic that it
changed from a [Rumor] to an [Urban Legend]. And that kind of [Rumor] is
like this one.
There was a rumor that had spread on the internet about a gamer named 『　
　』[1]. According to more than 280 Online Game Rankings, there was a
player with an undefeated record that always stood proudly at top of the
rankings with 『　　』 as his name. "There is no way something like that could
exist" may be what you are thinking. That was also what everyone else
believed and it became a simple hypothesis.
'That was just the doing of the development staff to make the game become
popular using a player with the name 『　　』. In reality, that kind of player
does not exist at all.'
The game developers who did not expose the identity of 『　　』 caused an
unknowingly explosive action to happen, like a form of beauty, with this
player who did not exist—
But the strange thing was that he participated in wars and many players have
faced against him.
He was unrivaled...just like a raging storm.
He was said...to have beaten a Grandmaster level chess program completely.
He was said...to have an aberrant playing style and having a hand that was
hard to read.
He was said...to have been using Tool Assists, and to have relied on Cheat
Codes.
He was said.....was said.....was said.....
One who was interested in that [Rumor] decided to investigate it further.
The method was not that hard. If a person was placed first in either a
Consumer Game, PC Game, or Social Game, that person would surely have
an account. And if that account exists, the list of achievements can also be
investigated.
But the one that investigated it further actually fell into a trap. Because 『　　』
in reality had his own account for every game console and SNS, and same
with the number of games, it was [Countless]. He didn't have even one black
spot in his win-loss records.
--With that, the mystery thickened and some even hypothesized that 『　　』
was a hacker that erased his own loss records, a group of gamers that only
high-level players were invited to, etc.
With this, a new [Urban Legend] was born.
—However, in this case, the person who created this 『　　』 rumor must also
be responsible.
Because he had an account, he was given the right to speak, but he
completely ignored this privilege.
Silent, not even communicating at all.
Since there was no provision of information, everything was a mystery
besides the fact that 『　　』 was Japanese.
No one has seen his real face—— This had also been the main reason why
the urban legend was accelerating.
—So.
—Let us introduce.
—The truth.
Crowned in the world ranking for his victorious battles in over 280 games.
This record has never been broken since the establishment of his identity, the
legendary player.
『　　』—his true identity———!
Part 2
"...Aa.....I'm dying....aa, now I died for real.....hey, my little sister, hurry up,
rez[2], rez~!"
"*Zuzu*......It is impossible....to use my feet for controlling the mouse...."
"Whatever hurry up, my little sister--Or should I say, my sly little sister--even
though I have not even eaten for three days, you are eating instant noodles?
On top of that, you're doing so while in battle."

"Nii, you want to eat too...? Something like Calorie Mate[3] or so...."
"Ah, that thing that only those bourgeois eat[4]. Like hell I'll eat something like
that. That aside, please hurry up and rez!"
"...*Zuzuzu*.....here, Nii's share."
"Oh! Thank you~.....by the way, what time is it now?"
"Let's see......still eight o' clock at night."
"What a novel way to describe eight o' clock in the morning as 'night'. Then,
what day is today?"
"....Who knows? Wait....one, two.....four cup of instant noodles so.......fourth
day?"
"Wait, my little sister. I don't mean how much time has passed since we
started pulling all-nighters gaming. What I mean is the 'date' of today."
"Does that even matter.....to Nii who is a NEET?"
"Of course it matters--something like an online event or tournament could
have happened!"
--Like that, was a conversation of a certain boy and girl while playing net
games.
Their glances met with each other's inside the room as they chatted.
The size of the room was around sixteen tatami mats[5]. Considerably wide.
However, inside it was full of game consoles, four consoles for each person--
so a total of eight of them.
On the floor there were many game packages that were already unsealed,
and also [Food]- which were instant noodle packages and mineral water
bottles scattered on the floor, which made the sense of 'wide' unable to be felt
at all.
The LED display gave off a faint light and the only source of light other than
that was the sunlight that was even now blocked by curtains.
"...Nii, are you.......not going to find a job?"
"--Then why didn't you also go to school, my little sister?"
"..."
"..."
Just like that they ended their conversation and no one spoke on the subject
thereafter.
The older brother--Sora. Eighteen years old. No occupation. A virgin.
Unpopular. Unable to communicate well. Game freak. Wearing a T-shirt and
jeans that gave the impression of being a shut-in with unkempt black hair.
The little sister--Shiro. Ten years old. Truant. Didn't have any friends. A
bullied child. Anthropophobia.[6] Game freak. One would doubt whether she
had a blood relation or not with her brother because she had white hair in
contrast to her brother's. Her hair was so long that it flowed down over her
face and she wore the school sailor uniform that she never even worn since
she transferred schools.
That was the true identity of (空白) which was the combination of their
names, Sora (空) and Shiro (白).
—This is the truth.
If everybody knew this, nobody would want to pursue or accept this truth,
and would continue to keep hugging the illusions of the urban legend.
『 』
Kuuhaku
Part 3
Now, it seems that the process of forming an [Urban Legend] has already
been explained.
In short, that was Humanity's [Desire], born from the disorder of this world.
It was not 'inevitable', but it was closer to an 'accident'.
The world is unreasonable and irrational.
It has no meaning at all.
The desire of one who recognized and yet didn't accept the truth of this can
make the boring world more interesting. Born from earnest [Desire], namely
—an [Urban Legend].
Then, how about I lend a hand to make the world become a bit more
interesting, by making a new [Urban Legend]?
--For now, let's write with stylistic beauty like this.
--The story begins with this opening.
--[Have you ever heard about this rumor?]
One day, an e-mail came to a 'person' that was said to be this world's best
gamer.
It was only a short, mysterious message with an additional URL inside it.
When one has clicked on it, a certain game will be started.
Once that person has cleared that game, they will......
Part 4
"....Argh, enough with this already.......gonna sleep."
"Wait! You are the one that's in charge of the team's recovery, and if you log
out--"
".....If it's you, Nii, you will be able to do it."
"Theoretically it is possible! If I operate my own two characters with both my
hands and also two of yours using both my feet after all--"
".....Fi...ght!"
"Wait! Please wait a moment, my little sister! If you sleep I will surely die----
Uoooooooo, you see, I've gone and died!"
The stack of instant noodle cups had already become a tower five cups tall.
Which also means that these siblings have already done all-nighters gaming for
five days straight.
Even knowing that her brother was in a bitter situation, Shiro still slept
anyway, using a game console as her pillow.
Ring--
Suddenly a tone notifying the siblings that they had mail sounded.
"....Nii, an e-mail."
"Just what are you demanding from your brother who's currently playing using
four characters on four different screens? You still want a request from me,
but I really have no more extra strength!"
He skillfully operated the mouse using both his hands and his feet. He
furiously commanded a party of four by himself and answered in one breath.
"I'm sure it's just another advertisement e-mail anyway, just ignore it--"
"....What if....it came from a friend?"
"Whose friend?"
"...Nii's."
"Haha, how weird, somehow I can feel you stabbing me through my chest
with such an ironic statement, my lovely sister."
"I don't...want you to say...it's mine.........."
"Then it's an advertisement e-mail after all. Or should I say, if you want to
sleep, just sleep! If you're not going to sleep, please help me a bit here--
Noooo, died, I've died!"
Let's repeat it again. Eighteen years old. Without an occupation. A cherry
boy. Unpopular. Unable to communicate well. Game freak. It's not boasting
but, it wasn't just that he didn't have a girlfriend, he didn't have even one
person that could be called a [Friend]. That was also the same with the little
sister.
"...Uu....what a bother."
Shiro tried to wake her consciousness and muster all her strength to get up. It
would be no problem if that really was an advertisement. But, one that
couldn't be ignored is an advertisement about a new game.
"....Nii, where is the tablet PC...?"
"At three o'clock from there, in the second mountain of eroge from the left,
and placed around the third and forth box--Uooooo, my feet are getting
cramped!"
Ignoring the brother who was in anguish, Shiro easily found it in the exact
location that Sora specified. Perhaps one would question why a hikikomori
and a NEET would need a tablet PC. But that is of course a foolish question,
because the answer is obviously that it is used for gaming. But, that was not
the main use of the tablet PC. For countless games they also need countless
e-mail addresses, but even excluding the addresses that were not for gaming
use, there were still more than 30 e-mail accounts which were all
synchronized. This is what true efficiency is.
"....The sound is Ring-- so it came from..... the third address of the main
account......is it this one?"
The white-haired girl whose memory was extraordinary compared to an
ordinary person, easily found the message.
And then—the person at the back who lead a successful crusade against
people in real-time combat by manipulating four roles at once, let out a roar
of triumph, before she viewed the e-mail.
【New mail----Subject: To the both of you, 『　　』.】
"...?"
Shiro bent her head slightly.
E-mails that were addressed to 『　　』 were not rare.
War Requests, Invitations, Provocative Challenges--those are what they
would commonly receive, but--
"...Nii."
"What is it, my cruel little sister who said that she wanted to sleep and
abandoned your brother alone in the game, and in the end didn't sleep and still
left your physically tired brother to play?""
"....This."
As if she didn't hear the sarcasm from her brother who didn't look like he was
about to listen, Shiro showed the mail to her brother.
"Hmm---what is this?"
The brother noticed that the mail looked peculiar.
"Saving. Okay, that's done. Checking the item drops, that's done too."
After checking that there was nothing wrong, Sora closed the game screen
that had been continuously running since five days ago and switched it to his
inbox to check out the e-mail that he had just received.
"...How does this guy know that 『　　』 is actually a pair of siblings?"
There were actually a lot of people that hypothesized that 『　　』 was actually
a group of people, but the main problem lies not from the what was written as
the subject, but from the content that said--
【Have you siblings ever felt that you guys were born into the wrong world?】
"What.....is this?"
"............."
It was a somewhat, no, it was a considerably strange message. It also
included a URL that they had never seen before. At the end of the URL,
there was no [.jp] to represent the country domain name. This URL was
pointed to a specific page—and it looked like it was linked to a game.
"...What should we do?"
Shiro who did not seem very interested, went back to her game console
pillow and tried to sleep. Which means that she would just leave the decision
up to her brother--
"Hmm, so 'you' plan on making me take a bet on it, huh. Well, even if this
thing turns out to be just a bluff in the end, let's just treat it as another
amusement."
He made that decision and clicked on the URL. He was on full alert in case of
a virus infection, while the security software was running full throttle. What
appeared there on the screen was just simple online chess.
".....*Yawn*...good night..."
"Wait wait wait! This is a challenge for 『　　』, you know. If the other party
has an advanced chess program, just me alone will not be enough to win!"
Sora tried to stop his sister from sleeping.
"...Who plays chess well...these days...."
"Umm, I know how you feel but...."
A program that was able to beat even the strongest Grandmasters. Even with
that, the little sister had lost interest in chess after beating this program twenty
consecutive times.
"It wouldn't be forgiven if 『　　』 lost. Please at least stay awake until we
know the extent of the opponent's ability."
"....Uuuu.....it can't be helped."
And then Sora started the game. After seeing her brother do one move, two
moves, Shiro began to nod off because of the sense of sleepiness that had
piled up. Five moves, ten moves, and before he knew it half of the board had
already been filled with pieces. Shiro suddenly snapped her eyes open and
stared at the screen.
"...Huh? This guy is...."
While Sora was feeling uncomfortable, Shiro stood up and said something.
"...Nii, change players..."
Without any objections, Sora obediently stood up from the chair and moved.
Shiro thought that her older brother could do no more at this point. In other
words, Shiro recognized that the other party was a worthy opponent. The
little sister who had just changed places with her brother started to plan her
moves.
Chess is a [Zero-sum game of limited decisions]. In this game where [Luck]
was non-existent and occasionally point game. In theory, a surefire way to
win existed, but in the end that is just theory. It is based on mastering and
being able to see every single possible move- 10^120 of them. A person who
could do that surely did not exist.
But there was someone who could assert that [Existence], and that was
Shiro. She had mastered and could comprehend the large--no, enormous--
amount of possible moves in chess. If you keep choosing the best chess
moves, then you will have the upper hand and win if you go first. If you went
second the way of escape was a draw. That is how the theory goes. What
about against an opponent who could foresee two hundred million moves in a
second? This world's strongest chess program was proven to not be perfect
enough for the little sister when she had won 20 consecutive victories against
it.
"....No way."
And that kind of strongest player had just been surprised by what was in front
of her.
"Calm down. This, I'm sure the other party is human."
"Why?"
"In a program's case, it would always choose the best move to play. In one
way that is a good thing, but on the other hand it also means that it can only
use tactics that it was already programed to use. That's why you can win
against them easily. But this guy is--"
Sora pointed at the screen.
"The other party lured you in and made you play a bad move, and if you feel
that it is natural for a program to do that, then you would be wrong."
"....Uuu."
The little sister was unable to object to her older brother's words.
--Of course, regarding their abilities playing chess, no, in most games Shiro
and Sora were overwhelmingly strong. Perhaps calling them by the title
"genius gamers" would not be an exaggeration. In Shiro's case, she can only
act based on her logic. That's why she can easily defeat even the most
powerful advanced chess programs. However, her ability in sensing other
people's [Motives] is dull. That's why at times like this, Shiro needed to leave
it to Sora. Even though he had poor communication skills, his perception in
feeling other peoples' [Motives] was unexpectedly outstanding.
"Calm down, if the opponent is not a program, all the more reason that there's
no way you will lose. Don't be taken in by his provocation. I will point out
every one of his provocations and tactics so that you beat him."
".....Understood.....Shiro will do her best..."
This is the reason behind their success in becoming the world's best gamer.
The game had now been running for more than six hours. Adrenaline and
dopamine were flowing from their brains, making them forget their fatigue
from doing all-nighters gaming for five days, and helping them concentrate to
the utmost limit. Six hours--but that felt to them as if the game had already
lasted for several days.
Finally, the last decisive moments happened. And then a emotionless voice
signaling the end of the game could be heard from the speakers.
'Checkmate'
That was the siblings' win.
""...""
After a long silence--
""Fuaaaaaaah.""
They each took a long breath. It was almost as if the game had made them
forget to breathe. After taking another long breath, the two started laughing.
"Amazing......it's been a while.....since I've played in a hard fight like this."
"Haha, that was the first time I ever saw you have a hard time when dealing
with a simple game though, right?"
"...Nii, is the opponent.....really a human?"
"Yes, I'm sure of it. He took a lot of time when deciding to provoke you into
a trap to make you play a bad move, and when it didn't work I could sense a
feeling of disturbance from him. I'm sure he is a human--or maybe a
'monster'."
"...I wonder what kind of person he is."
The little sister that was even able to beat a Grandmaster level chess program
sounded interested.
"Maybe a Grandmaster? Programs are exact, but a human is complex after
all."
"...I see...next time....I want to play....Shogi against that Dragon King."
"Will the Dragon King even accept your shogi challenge? Why don't we find
out!"
After the game, the two of them felt a great sense of happiness and grinned
happily while they were talking.
Ring--
Suddenly, the mail notification tone could be heard.
"Hey, maybe that e-mail just now is from the opponent. Try opening it."
".....Un."
But the content of the e-mail was only one sentence.
【Well done. With that kind of ability, I am sure you find living to be painful?】
With only that single sentence, it was as if their mental states had dropped to
zero degrees. Silence filled the room, and only the sound of the PC's fans
could be heard. Countless wires were strewn over the floor, along with
scattered trash and clothes. It felt as if time was frozen in that room where
curtains blocked out the sunlight, and a sense of deprivation of space filled the
air. Isolated in the narrow sixteen tatami sized room. This was the world the
siblings were in—all of it.
--Unpleasant memories were running through their minds.
The older brother, who naturally excelled at reading people's true motives just
by hearing their words. The white haired, red eyed little sister, who by nature
had high intelligence--but was a person that no one could understand. The
two siblings had shut their hearts after their parents passed away. No matter
how optimistically they tried to recount memories of the past— No, even now
it was still the same.
The little sister silently bowed.
Not long after thinking that, the older brother angrily started to type a reply.
【None of your business! Who the hell are you anyways?】
A reply came almost right away after he replied to the message. No, whether
it could really be called a reply or not could be doubted because the content
of this new e-mail was--
【What do you guys think about this world? Is it interesting? Is it a place that
can make you guys feel at ease?】
Because of these words, the older brother forgot about his anger and made
eye contact with his younger sister.
There was no need to reconfirm, the answer has long been clear from the
start.
"It's a shit game[7]."
...With no clear objectives or rules, a stupid game.
Around seven billion players move as they please.
Ones that have more than others get penalized. The little sister who was now
isolated, was isolated because she was smarter than those of her age-- no
one could understand her and she was bullied.
Even ones that have less than others get penalized. The older brother, The
always smiling brother who always failed, even when scolded by parents or
teachers.
Never had the rights to skip.
--Silence only made one a target to be bullied by others.
--Talking too much made one become alienated by others.
--Being able to read peoples' real intentions too much also made one become
alienated by others.
No clear objectives, no parameters, even the genre is unknown.
Ones that do as the rules say are punished, yet ones that ignore the rules are
not punished and even look down from their positions as the elite. No game
could be compared with this kind of difficult, worst game.
"Damn it!"
Sora grit his teeth and caressed his little sister's head.
The atmosphere of those two who felt like they could stand in the realm of
gods after that exciting game was gone. What was there, was only these two
siblings who were isolated from society. They were only but depressed, frail
humans.
The sound Ring-- could suddenly be heard.
The older brother controlling the cursor did not care and was about to shut
down the computer. But, his sister held his hands to stop him.
【What if a world where everything was decided by a simple game existed--】
Sora, who had actually tried to turn off the PC just then, was unable to do
anything other than read that after seeing those words.
【--A world where the objectives and rules were clear, a world on top of a
game board, what do you think?】
The two exchanged looks, laughing, and both of them nodded their heads.
Then the older brother began typing on the keyboard.
【If that kind of world actually does exist, then that really does mean that we
were born into the wrong world.】
Is what he replied after he read the content of the letter.
Suddenly--
-Shaaaaa.
The PC's screen gave off a faint noise and then it made a sound like a circuit
breaker overloading. After that sound, nothing else could be heard and it was
as if everything had stopped; only the screen with the e-mail had been left
moving.
"Just what is--"
"...!"
Noise could be heard within the room. There was a sound that sounded like
the house itself was creaking, and there was also the sound of an electrical
discharge. The brother panicked and quickly looked around the room, and
the little sister just stared, dumbfounded. After that, the noise became
increasingly intense and finally became a sound that was not unlike that of the
static noise from an empty TV channel. And then from the speakers--no,
from the screen of the computer, a [Voice] could be heard.
[I also think the same. You two were born into the wrong world.]
Suddenly a pair of white hands appeared from the screen.
"Wha--!"
"...Hiii!"
The hands dragged both of them by the wrists towards the screen.
[I will let you siblings be born again- again, in the world where you two
should have been born!]
Their vision filled with a blinding white light, and they shut their eyes.
When they had opened their eyes again, the first thing that they noticed was
the light and warmth of the sun. It had been a while since they had last felt it,
and also the sensation of the retinas being burned by the light. The brother
who had come to his senses first, after his pupils adjusted, noticed that they
were both high up in the sky.
"Uooooooooooo!"
The scenery had suddenly shifted from a narrow room to a vast expanse of
space.
They were--in the air.
Suddenly appearing in the vast sky, Sora, who finally grasped the situation
shouted.
"What the hell is thiiiiis!"
No matter how he saw it, no matter how many times he looked, he was sure
that the whole island underneath him--and other islands as well-- were
floating. There was also a certain creature that had flown by him in the sky, a
dragon. In the distance, he could see a number of immensely large chess
pieces near a range of mountains, which could have made people lose their
sense of distance.
'What's with this fantasy-like kind of entrance?' is what was floating through
Sora's mind. The scenery, no matter how many times he tried to compare it,
was not the same scenery from the [Earth] that he knew. But the main
problem right now, he quickly realized, was not that. Currently, they were
both skydiving without a single parachute--a free fall.
"I'm going to die!"
It took 3 seconds for him to be convinced of this.
But, as if to break this sorrowful confirmation, a loud shouting could be heard
beside him.
"Welcome to my world!"
The [Boy] falling beside him said while opening his arms and laughing.
"This is the Utopia that you guys dreamed of, the world on top of a game
board, [Disboard]--everything here is decided by a game, even one's life and
country borders!"
Sora probably understood about 10 seconds later.
Shiro, who understood the situation as soon as she opened her eyes,
embraced her brother while crying.
".....Who are you--?"
Shiro tried her best to shout while falling at a frighteningly high speed, but
ended up only murmuring her question. But the boy answered while still
smiling like usual.
"Me? About me~ I....live there."
He said that while pointing in the direction of the giant chess pieces near the
horizon, which Sora had seen for the first time only a short while ago.
"Hmm, in your world you might call me 'God', right?"
Placing his index finger on his cheek, the self-proclaimed god spoke cutely
and full of friendliness.
—However, nobody knew if what he said was true.
"This isn't the time for that! We're falling towards the ground at a really fast
speed--whoaaah! Shiro!"
"...............................!"
Not knowing if it would do any good, Sora held Shiro within his arms and
then he turned his body so that he would be below Shiro. After that, Shiro
who was in Sora's arms issued a soundless scream.
Seeing that, the boy who called himself God spoke to them with a happy
tone.
"I look forward to seeing you again. Yes, without a doubt, it won't be long."
And like that, their consciousnesses blacked out.
Part 5
"U....Uun....."
The feeling of soil. The aromatic smell of grass. When Sora had recovered his
consciousness, he realized that he was on the ground.
"Just what the hell was that...."
Was this a dream? Is what Sora thought but he didn't say it out loud.
"....Uu....what a weird dream."
The little sister who woke up a bit later than Sora moaned.
Hey, little sister. Don't raise the "isn't this a dream" flag. Sora thought about
saying this, but deliberately decided against it.
While having such thoughts, Sora stood up and pretended that nothing had
happened, but what was under his feet was undoubtedly land.
The fresh blue sky, which he had also not seen in a while, was above him.
"Whoaaaaa!"
Sora realized that he was standing on the edge of a cliff, and hurriedly backed
off by two steps.
Then, overlooking the landscape across the cliff.
An incredible landscape was laid out before his eyes.
......No, that expression wasn't right. It was a different word, but what?
There were floating islands and dragons. And across the mountains on the
horizon were huge chess pieces.
This means that it was the view they had of the world while falling.
Which means that--it was not a dream...
"Hey, my little sister."
".....Un...."
Overlooking the picturesque view of the landscape, he said.
"I've always thought that 'life' was an impossible game--a game that was fit
only for masochists."
"......Un....."
And then they said with their voices in harmony.
""So it finally bugged out, huh...enough, what the hell is this super awful shit
game!""
After that— both of them lost consciousness again.
Part 6
--[Have you ever heard about this rumor?]
One day, an e-mail came to a 'person' that was said to be this world's best
gamer.
It was only a short, mysterious message with an additional URL inside it.
When one has clicked on it, a certain game will be started.
Once that one has cleared that game, they will disappear from 'this' world.
And then that person will be invited to a parallel universe.
That kind of [Urban Legend] which invited people to another world....will you
believe it?
Chapter 1 - Beginner/Amateur
Part 1
—In a past that was far too long ago.
The Old Deus [8] competed with the ultimate prize of being the supreme, sole
God on the line and started a war, along with their servants and created
beings.
This war lasted for a long, long time, so long it felt numbing.
There was no land that was not stained with blood, and cries of agony had
never ceased to echo through the skies.
The races with knowledge hated each other, slaughtered each other, and
continued to repeat their countless killings.
The elves had small villages as their bases, and they cast magic to hunt their
enemies.
The dragons used their bodies for killing purposes, and the warbeasts
devoured their prey like animals.
The land that was swallowed by the sunset and became a barren land was
swallowed by the deeper darkness due to the wars amongst the old Deus.
The ‘Demon Lords’ and their allied monsters that were created by the
Fantazma went rampant and dominated the land.
In this kind of world, no further numbers of nobility, beauties or even warriors
would work.
Humans were just an insignificant existence.
They had to bet their lives on building their countries and forming clans just to
survive.
The legendary hero who could be hailed by the bards did not appear—and
just like that, it was a blood-stained era.
This was a story that was far longer and older than the skies, seas and land—
called the ‘Disconnect Board’.
However, the war they thought would continue for eternity suddenly ended.
The skies, seas, land—and even the stars that filled the skies.
They lost the will to continue this emaciated, weary war where they were it
was tantamount to die without benefits.
And just like that—at this point, the Old Deus with the most amount of power
left sat on the only throne for a sole God.
And so, this Deus who had been watching from the sidelines all this while...
Abstaining from the war from the beginning till the end.
The Deus sat on the throne, looking at the devastation on the land around
him.
He declared to all the people roaming on the land.
"—To everyone, who used up all extremes of strength, violence, desperation,
and death.
Show me proof that you, who built towers of corpses, are knowledgeable
beings as you so claim."
'What is the difference between you and the ‘unintelligent beasts’?
All the races unanimously said that there was no need to prove their own
intelligence.
But, in front of this barren and abandoned world, this discourse was too
empty.
Ultimately, there was no answer that was accepted by God.
God said.
—From this piece of Heaven, I command that there will be no plundering or
bloodshed.
Those words became an [Oath], becoming the absolute unchanging law of the
world.
From that day onwards, [War] disappeared from the world.
But the population that considered themselves rational sent complaints to god
in unison.
Even if [War] has disappeared, [Conflict] still exists—
God said, in that caseThose
of the [Sixteen Races] that claim to be the most intelligent creatures.
Those who use all extremes of your reason, intelligence, ability and financial
resources.
Build towers of wisdom, and through that thou shalt prove thy own
intelligence.
God took out sixteen chess pieces—and laughed maliciously.
Thus, the [Ten Oaths] were born, and [War] disappeared from the world.
All disputes were resolved by [Games].
That was the law of the sole God, and that God's name was—TET.
Part 2
Andalusia continent, the Kingdom of Elchea, the Capital-- Elchea.
An area limited to the southern part of the equator, stretching to the northeast
of the continent, was a small country that was located in the westernmost
part, but it was more accurate to say that it was a small city.
It was a country that had previously occupied half of the continent in mythical
times, but now it has lost its former glory.
What was left was the last of the once great empire— A small and vulnerable
country.
—More precisely.
This was also the last kingdom for the human species.
—At the outskirts of the city not far away.
A tavern and inn that could only exist in RPG games was the first floor of a
building.
There were two people who were surrounded by many viewers, two girls that
were currently playing a game on a table.
One of the girls looked to be around 15 or 16 years old, having red hair while
giving out a sense of elegance with her manners and dress.
As for the other person—
Although she looked very alike in age with the redhead, her temperament and
clothing gave out a sense of maturity in other peoples' points of view.
Wearing a black veil draped over her head, resembling a mourning shawl—
was a black-haired girl.
As for the ongoing game that they were having........it seemed to be poker.
The expressions on both their faces were in deep contrast, with the redhead
having a stern look due to anxiety.
On the other hand, the deadpan poker face on the black-haired girl face
made everyone peek at the color of calmness.
Anyways—the red-haired girl was losing thoroughly.

"......Hey, can you hurry it up?"
"An, annoying. I am still thinking."
—It was a pub, and the already drunken audience roared with vulgar laughter
in the broad daylight.
This added a shade of distress onto the red-haired girl's face.
But in any case——the scene as of now emerged as bustling.
…………—
During a game that was held outside the pub.
Sitting at a table next to open air, a young girl who was wearing a hood
peered through the window from the side and said.
"........How.....lively.........what happened?"
"Ah? Don't you foreigners know at all?—-But then again, there isn't any other
human country left."
Sitting next to the girl who was peeping into the window, were two people
that were playing a game on the table.
Playing, were a teenage male who was also hooded just like the young girl, as
well as a bearded middle-aged man with a bulging beer belly.
The teenager replied.
"Ah—because we are from the countryside, we are not clear with situations
regarding the metropolis."
Coincidentally, both of them were also playing the same game as the ones
inside.......[Poker].
—Only, the bargaining chips they used were bottle caps.
Because of the remarks by that teenager, the middle-aged man said
doubtfully.
"The so-called humans that don't live in this country...........aren't they
hermits?"
"Haha, that is true. Okay, so what is all the commotion inside?"
The bearded man got shot back with the question after cleverly avoiding it.
".......Right now, there is currently a gambling tournament to [Elect the next
king] for Elchea."
With eyes watching the situation in the pub, the hooded girl continued asking.
".......Elect........the next king?"
"Yes. These were the previous king's last words before dying."
[The next king shall not be inherited by blood relations, but the coronation of
"Humanity's strongest gambler".]
Continuing to add on the bottle caps, the bearded man said.
"In the fight to gamble for the country, the human species were defeated.
Now there is only Elchea, which is also the capital of this country—so there
was no time to look decent now."
"Huuu, [Gambling for the country], eh.......that seems to be something very,
very interesting."
The hooded teen replied.
He was very alike to the hooded girl, feeling very concerned and peeping into
the pub to look at the situation.
"—Well, why? Are those kids like the candidates to be the next king?"
"Un? The so-called word [Candidate] seems wrong, because as long as you
are a human, anyone is eligible to participate."
Just—adding these words, the man moved his line of sight towards the tavern.
—Obviously playing poker, but she does not seem to know the meaning of
the word "poker face".
Giving a glance to the red-haired girl whose whining voice could be heard and
her intent while staring at the opponent's hand could be felt, the man said.
"That red-haired girl over there is called "Stephanie Dora"— the previous
king's blood kin. If they followed his will, about a non-royal nor blood-related
person becoming the king, then she will lose everything, so her goal is to
become the next king."
The blood kin of that guy who made humanity lose, never expected to have
such desperate children......
Added the man before sighing, bluntly commenting on the noise inside.
".........Huuu....."
"Un.......[Gambling for the country]—even the so-called borders are decided
with games, right?"
The hooded girl and teen expressed their feelings.
The girl felt admiration.
The teen felt interest.
"Whatever the case, the system of the gambling tournament is heating up
considerably."
".........Round robin?"
"As long as you are a human, anyone can be the next king, so long as you
register your name. Regardless of the methods, it will be decided with a
game. The loser will be deprived of qualification while the last man standing
will be the king."
—So, the rules are simple. The easier it is to understand, the better it is.
But, the hooded teen doubtfully said.
"........It really is that casual, eh. Wouldn't there be any problems?"
"As long as you respect the [Ten Oaths], with both sides judging each other,
there would be no restrictions, nor any restriction on the competition mode—
Including who, what to use and at what time. After all, it is a national gambling
thing for the country."
"......No, I don't mean that."
The hooded teen muttered in an eloquent tone while looking into the pub
again.
The girl whispered to the teen.
".......Of course, total defeat."
"Ahh, we think of the same things."
Saying it to each other, the teen took out a square-shaped item from his
pocket.
Facing towards the tavern, he operated it for a while before it sounded with a
'Kacha'.
—After that, the middle-aged man secretly laughed.
"So, little brother? It isn't the time for you to think of the outcome of other
people, right?"
Apologizing, the man suddenly spread out his cards.
"Full house. Sorry, eh."
The man who was convinced that he had won—thought of the people that
would be his later and leaked out a nasty smile.
—But, looking at the hooded teen.
He still showed that disinterested face he had since the start.
But now a reaction came and he gave out a response.
"Eh? Ah—sorry. Oh, yes."
Saying this, the teen casually revealed his poker and the middle-aged man
stared in disbelief.
"A roy, royal straight flush—!?"
Towards the man who stayed emotionless and yet received the best hand in
the game, the man got up and roared.
"You, you guys cheated me, right!?"
"Hey, hey, hey, how rude.......do you have any evidence?"
Facing against the teen who exposed a thin smile and was preparing to get up
from his seat, the man continued speaking mercilessly.
"The probability of getting a royal straight flush is only 1/650000, how could
you get it so easily!"
"Then today must be the day where I hit that 1 out of 650000 chances right,
Uncle? You really do have bad luck, eh."
Leisurely leaving behind this sentence, the teen spread his hands wide.
"Then, could you get me what you had "bet"?"
"—You deserve to die."
Clucking his tongue, the man took out his wallet and purse.
"Article six of the [Ten Oaths], 'As per the oath, the wager will be
unconditionally adhered to'— Okay, I will accept it."
".....Thank you......Uncle."
The hooded teen stood up casually after finishing and left.
After nodding with a bow, the girl started chasing after the figure of that teen.
At that time, a figure that seemed to be a friend approached the bearded man
who was watching the two people stroll into the pub.
"Hey, although we were all watching from start to end, why did you have to
bet on "Everything you had"?"
"Ah.......Oh my God, what am I going to do about the living expenses."
"No, compared to that, what did they bet on, making you put up all your
living expenses?"
Sighing, the bearded man responded listlessly.
"They said [Free to do whatever you want with us two]."
"What—"
"Although I felt it was a little too fitting ......But I thought it would work seeing
that they are from the countryside.........So how?"
"You can't do anything about it.......Oh yeah, which one would you choose?"
"—Ha?"
"But......bisexual or lolicon, both are out of your league, eh....."
"Wuh- hey, hey, wait a moment!"
"What, ah~ don't worry, I will keep it a secret from Kamei-san. As a
consideration, you have to treat me♪"
"No, not that! Moreover, my cash has already been taken away! Compared
to this—"
"The condition bet did not only include the girl's chastity, it was also
equivalent to [Betting two peoples' lives], but the case of getting a royal
straight flush while looking so absent-minded? What exactly is backing up
those two guys......"
—………
"........Nii.....cunning."
"Ah? Why did that come out from you too."
".......Deliberately using......that kind.......of cheat that sticks out by a mile."
—Yep, it was exactly what the man had said.
The royal straight flush could not have simply appeared that easily.
Coming up with this kind of hand was tantamount to declaring openly that you
were cheating.
But—
"Article eight of the [Ten Oaths], once cheating has been discovered in a
game, it will be deemed as a defeat—"
The teen muttered out the rule of this world he had just remembered.
"—Which means, as long as you are not found out then you can do it. Isn't
receiving acknowledgement nice."
The teen's argument revealed that he had only conducted a simple
experiment, before stretching his waist.
"Well, at least we earned some military spendings."
"........Nii............understands.....how the money works here?"
"It's impossible to know, right? But, leave this to me- this is within your
brother's field of expertise."
The teen said it with a tone that the bearded man and his friend had never
heard,
Before walking into the building that had the inn and tavern.

Part 3
Despite the bustling commotion due to the heated game on the central table,
two people walked to the counter.
Reaching the counter, the hooded teen took out his wallet from his purse and
emptied the coins out, before asking slowly.
"I'd like a room for two. One bed is enough. How many nights will this
amount of money get us?"
The figure which had a boss-like aura glanced over quickly.
After a moment of hesitation.
".........One day with three meals."
However, the hooded teen laughed towards this remark— and with his eyes
covered by the hood, continued talking.
"Ah haah~I said. Ah, after trekking for five nights straight, the fatigue is
enough to kill me. We are totally exhausted already—so could you quickly
tell me, [How many nights can we stay]?"
"—What?"
"Although we do look like country people who don't know the monetary
value, it's fine with me if you want to raise the price. But, I recommend that
when you lie, please take note of your line of sight and tone of voice, 'kay ~♪"
The teen laughed while saying these words- it appeared that his eyes had a
keen radiance that saw right through him.
With the boss sweating nervously, he sucked in his lips and replied.
".......Che. Two days, then."
"You see, lying again.....let's just compromise this- ten days with meals
provided, then."
"Wha! What kind of compromise is that!!? You, fine... three days with meals,
how meddlesome!"
"Ah, so it's like that, eh. Then a discount, five days with food attached."
"Wuh—"
"You are trying to deceive customers into pumping out their oil before lining
your own pockets with the money, then splurging it all, right?"
"Whu, wait, that sort of thing—"
"And you are the owner of this tavern but not the owner of the inn, right?
Should I report you?"
He had kept a smile on his face since the start of the conversation.
But facing against this teen who spared no pains to negotiate with him, the
boss could only make an awkward and stiff expression before replying,
"Little brother, you obviously have a worldly expression, but you're
unexpectedly ruthless, eh..........I get it, four days with meals provided, how's
that?"
"Okay~, thank you for the hospitality♪"
Still wearing that smile, the teen took the room keys from the man's hand.
"Your room's at the innermost corner on the third floor. What's........your
name?"
The hooded youth replied to the somewhat impatient boss who was holding
onto the register.
"Un~..........Kuuhaku[9] would do."
Sora purred and spun the keys on his fingers.
He suddenly patted the head of his little sister, who was ecstatically watching
the climax of the game on the central table.
"Look, I finished negotiations, we get to stay for four days. You may quickly
worship your onii-sama— what are you doing?"
Shiro was staring at that Stephen............something, the person introduced by
the bearded man early on.
A distressed expression was exposed on that girl's face.
Her askew expression made people think that that without a doubt, she did
not have a hope of victory.
"........That person— will lose."
"Probably. So what?"
Revealing her emotions without hiding them, even if there was a chance, she
still would not win.
Maybe it was as the bearded man had said, the lineage of the royal family are
stupid.
Just when this idea was emerging in Sora's mind—he realized.
"—Ah!"
Then, after figuring out the intentions of his sister's words, he could not help
but sigh.
"Whoa, so it is that kind of meaning……How scary……"
"..........Un."
Shiro was sizing up the black-haired girl while nodding at the sighing Sora.
"Really..........This world's cheating methods are truly incredible. I don't even
want to meet against these kinds of opponents......"
".........Nii, shameful....."
Probably provoking him, Sora suddenly got serious and countered back.
"Heh, don't be silly. No matter how clever a cheat is, it depends on how you
apply it."
"……Nii, could you.....beat it?"
"—But this really is worthy of a fantasy world, eh....... There really isn't any
sense of reality here, yet we both have a comfortable and relaxed
feeling........Is it because we've played too many games?"
Sora did not answer his little sister's question, but instead headed for the third
story of the building while rambling about non-related topics.
"...........Really, I asked........a stupid question."
Shiro suddenly apologized.
—Indeed, for 『　　』, failure was almost impossible.
Then..........after making contact by the shoulders.
For some reason—Sora turned towards Steph..........whatever, the redhaired
girl.
He thought about it in his mind for a moment— before whispering softly.
".......Oh, come on...can't you see you're being cheated?"
"—Eh?"
The girl with the striking red hair and contrasting round blue eyes suddenly
glanced over.
Even as he felt the girl who was mysteriously told off stare at his moving
figure.........Sora did not utter another word and went straight towards the
door of the room.
Part 4
Along with the turn of the key in the lock, came a lack of sense of security
when the metal hinge let out a squeaking sound before the door opened.
Inside the room— it was wood that was quite similar to the kind in Skyrim ,
making the house look kind of cheap.
The room was small, and creaking could be heard with every footstep on the
floor. The table and chairs that were arranged at the corners looked very
perfunctory.
As for the other things, there was only a bed and window. The interior was
quite simple.
Walking into the room and locking the door, the both of them removed their
hoods.
Wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers with matted black hair—Sora.
A mess of long white hair that covered her red eyes, a skinny girl who wore a
sailor uniform—Shiro.
Sora removed the borrowed robes that when worn, would not look
conspicuous in a world like this, before revealing a relieved look and threw
himself on the only bed.
Taking the phone out of his pocket— he checked off the task that was
planned beforehand.
"—[Goal]: Ensure accommodation—[Achieved]— it's safe to say *that*
now, right?"
"......Un[10], I think......we can."
After the confirmation, a thousand emotional words were released from the
heart.
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,so tired,
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh............."
These words......
It was decided early on to never say these until the goal was reached.
Afterwards, bursting out as he could no longer contain himself, were the
complaints about the story that came out of Sora's mouth.
"There is no such thing as [definitely impossible]- I can't believe that at our
first reunion with the outside world, we had to walk that far."
Similarly, taking off the robe revealed a folded white sailor uniform.
Opening the window, she confirmed the scenery.
From the window, you could barely see it— the cliff onto which they fell.
"........Humans, as long as they have the will, then it can be done."
"Yeah, if there is no motivation then nothing will be done— These realistic
words accurately express our current situation, eh."
Although it was such a negative interpretation— Shiro still nodded in
agreement.
"But I thought that my legs had become weak from being a hikikomori for so
long, so I never expected that we would be able to walk that far."
".........Because.....we control the mice.....with both our feet?"
"Oh— I see! The so-called 'mastering one skill so much until it carries into
everything else' thing was true then!"
".........That's not..........what I originally meant......I meant........"
This comical dialogue seemed to have reached its limit.
Shiro's eyes were half closed.
The little sister, who was staggering as if she was going to faint, fell on the bed
that Sora was on.
Although it didn't show on her face, the pained breath from her fatigue could
be felt.
—This was of course, a natural reaction.
No matter how much of a genius she was, she was still an eleven year old girl.
Dueling in a chess match after 5 all-nighters was enough to shock anyone with
that kind of stamina. Even Sora also felt pain and shifted around (although it
was only halfway). For a person to also come here without complaints was
truly worthy of being marveled.
Because Sora had decided before not to utter out a single complaint.
"You worked hard. How great— indeed, you are your brother's prided little
sister."
As if combing his little sister's hair, Sora stroked her head and said that.
"........Un. Find a place to sleep.......made sure.........that was completed."
"Ahhh, and of course, I was thinking what was going to happen to us when
we were attacked by those thieves."
—With these words, Sora's mind drifted back to a few hours ago.
That is— when both of them were lost and wandering around shortly after
being dumped in this world.
Part 5
"—Then, what do we do."
"........(Shakes head)"
Waking up and regaining a conscious state for the second time.
While cursing in his heart that life was being too unreasonable, the fatigued
Sora shouted to the pedestrians passing by.
After Shiro was temporarily relieved, she let out a sigh.
Both of them felt weary, but they still recovered their composure despite
being exhausted.
Moving away from the edge of the cliff, they then slumped onto the unpaved
roadside.
".........Nii, why come.....here?"
"You see, in an RPG game this would be called a [Street] right? I remember it
was to let someone go through some sort of....."
Although they didn't know to what extent their practical knowledge about
games could help them, but this sort of things should be placed aside first.
"—Well, first things first, let's inventory what things we currently have on
hand."
Just like any survival play-off game, Sora said it like this.
Understanding the point, both of them started taking everything out of their
pockets.
What were taken out—
Were Sora and Shiro's respective smart phones, two of them.
Handheld game consoles, two of them.
Two multipurpose batteries. Two solar power chargers, with multiple
charging outlets.
And the last thing was a tablet PC in Shiro's hand.
.....No matter how you looked at it, it was hard to imagine lost victims with
such expensive equipment.
And— they were all used to play games.
Because no matter where they were, be it on the toilet or in the bathroom—
or even during a power outage, they could always play games, so these were
items that could not leave their persons.
——Actually, nobody knew whether or not these items could be useful in an
actual difficult crisis, they were mysterious and yet substantial pieces of
equipment.
"..........Sure enough, electrical waves and the like cannot be received in the
fantasy world."
Sora said, while looking at the display screen on his phone that told him he
was out of range.
—But, the backlight of the phone could be used as a flashlight at night, and it
could also take photos.
The map function—was of course ineffective, but it could still be used as a
compass.
Sora gave a heartfelt thanks to the recent high level performance
developments for smartphones.
"...........Okay, Shiro, turn off the phone and tablet PC. Take advantage of the
sun being up and charge the photo voltaic power generator. I downloaded an
e-book about games onto that tablet and in the worst case scenario, we will
just use the survival guide."
"........Roger—"
Shiro obediently listened to her brother's words and turned off the equipment
while using the solar charger to charge it up.
—When encountering unexpected circumstances, listening to her brother's
instructions was the best. Shiro knew this due to her own experience.
.........After that, using the power of science (Sora's phone), a direction to
head off was determined.
However, using the phone which only had a compass, their current status was
like being thrown into the sea without any nautical charts, so there weren't any
changes in the situation.
They were obviously holding the product of the most advanced scientific
technology, yet they still got lost in the way of life and fell onto the wayside.
"—Oh?"
Sora spotted a few people approaching from a side-street(or a Street),
pacing towards them.
"OHHH! How fantastic, my experience in RPGs really worked!"
".........Nii......they look......weird."
Finishing this sentence, the group suddenly picked up the pace and enclosed
them in a circle.
Dressed in green and easy to walk in boots—
"..........Wowhoa, aren't they thieves!"
Sora could not help but complain to the heavens.
Getting lost on the road and their first encounter was actually with [fantasy
world thieves!]
Facing against this ferocious bunch, in full accordance with a typical bad guy
group— Sora shielded Shiro with his body while really thinking of cursing the
heavens.
—But what came out of the thieves' mouths was.
"Hehe....if ya wanna get past— ya gotta play a game with us."
.............
This one sentence made the two siblings look at each other helplessly— but.
"—This, eh...that brat did say that this was [A world where everything is
decided by games]."
"...........Is that......how thieves here........are?"
The two people who quickly accepted that fact compared the thieves from
here with the ones from their own world.
They couldn't resist but smile after the comparison. This could even be
described as a cute scene compared to an encounter with a real thief, thus
forcing both of them to break out in laughter.
"What are you guys laughing about! If you don't have a game with us, don't
even think about getting past here."
Facing against two people who were laughing for no reason were the thieves.
The siblings then communicated with each other using a quiet voice that the
thieves couldn't eavesdrop on.
"One person deceives the others, then use cheats to cut off their escape route
— what do you feel?"
"............Is......good."
Finishing the conversation, Sora clapped his hands with a 'Pa!'
"OK, fine, let's have a showdown. But unfortunately for us, we are currently
penniless."
"Heh, no matter, then—"
But regardless of what the thieves said, Sora continued.
"If we lose then we are at your disposal, regardless of where we are sold to
or what is done to us."
"—Ah?"
The cheeky thief who was about to say out a proposal, was abruptly
interrupted, before getting surprised himself,
"In contrast, if we win—"
With a chilling smile on his face— the brother said.
"You will take us to the nearest street ♪, and give us the robes those two are
wearing. Because we are still wearing conspicuous clothing due to the transfer
of worlds, this is a must. And also about the game rules of this world,
truthfully tell them all to me☆"
Sora exerted his highly adaptable game brain.
He was already convinced that he would win and had even added some
additional requests.
Part 6
Thinking about back then, Sora whispered.
"[Ten Oaths]——eh. Shiro, do you remember?"
".......Un. Very..........interesting rules." Shiro, looking dazed and about to fall
asleep, replied.
They had learned about the rules of this world from the thieves (they were no
longer recognizable now) that had lost the game.
Taking out his phone on which he had written the rules, Sora reread them out
loud again.
【Ten Oaths】——
It appears that these were the absolute rules that [God] had laid down.
Although the little sister seemed to have easily memorized it, the brother had
still recorded them in his phone, which were as follows:
【1】 All bloodshed, war, and pillage is forbidden throughout the world.
【2】 All disputes are to be resolved through the outcome of games.
【3】 In games, wagers will be made on what both parties decide to be of
equal value.
【4】 Unless contrary to "Three", the game content and the things wagered do
not matter.
【5】 The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the game.
【6】 "As per the Oath", the wager will be unconditionally adhered to.
【7】 All matters for group conflicts will be decided by a representative.
【8】 If cheating is detected during a game, it will be regarded as a defeat.
【9】 The above rules are unconditionally everlasting, upheld in the name of
God.
"And 【Ten】—— Everyone should get along while playing games."
—…….
"Nine is used to wrap up everything from above it, but Ten......."
That is, it was not a mandatory requirement to get along with the opponent,
so to speak.
Or said in another way, 'Anyhow, it's not as if you guys are living in harmony
anyways'.
Feeling the irony of the 【Ten Oaths】, the mirthful face of that [God] surfaced
in Sora's mind.
"That kid that dragged us here into this world— if that person really is [God],
then he really does have good character.
Pocketing his phone, Sora said with a wry smile.
Just when the thought of lying on the bed came.
His fatigue suddenly welled up, and his consciousness began to blur, even his
thinking skills began to wear down.
"........If I think about it, of course it is a natural reaction. Pulling all-nighters
for five days and then the sudden onset of this event......"
"..........Fuu......."
Always thinking about being beside her brother, while clutching onto Sora's
wrist, was the little sister who had reached dreamland.
Sweeping away the bangs that were on her face revealed white skin that was
like ceramic and a beautiful face that was like a work of art.
Compared with the girl that had a doll-like refined appearance, saying that the
both of them were siblings could be perceived as a start of a bad joke.
"—Didn't I always say to at least cover yourself with a blanket......you will
catch a cold."
".........Un."
Complying with her brother's words, the little sister used a feeble voice to
request him to help her cover herself.
Although Sora covered his little sister with the blanket that smelled like dust
with a bit of hesitation, he still thought it was better than nothing.
Watching his Shiro's sleeping face and steady breathing, Sora suddenly
became lost in thought.
(—Then, from now on, where should I start.....)
Sora started fiddling with the phone which he had just taken out.
He wanted to try and see if there was any software that could help his
predicament.
(—This is a fantasy about being pulled into a different world, so first I should
think about and look to see if there is a method to go back......)
—Parents who were no longer in this world.
—A sister who was not accepted by society.
—Himself who did not accept society.
—Besides, the surprise that lies beyond the screen— this world.
"........Hey, Shiro...the protagonists of alternate world stuff...why did they
want to return back to 'that' kind of world?"
Even though he knew that she had fallen asleep, Sora still tried to raise this
question, but he did not receive an answer.
He thought about what he was going to do after the four days.
Sora was going to try and improvise— but before the conclusion of his
contemplations, the demon of sleep had already cut off his thoughts.

Part 7
—'Tok Tok!', this kind of sound rang in the air.
The reason why he would wake up only due to polite knocking—
Was because his senses had been sharpened due to coming to an unknown
place.
Sora loudly commanded the urges that wanted him to go back to sleep to
shut up, then quickly let his brain become active again.
".....Nyaaa~."
—But his little sister was different from him.
There was drool dribbling down her face and she was tightly grabbing onto
her brother's left arm while sleeping.
With a face that was more comforting than anything else, it would have made
anyone jealous of the one who got to see that dreaming expression.

"Yeah, thinking about it, in this world, killing, looting, and other things are
prohibited......."
Which means— things such as being vigilant, are not necessary in this world.
Probably understanding this point— no, she certainly understood.
Sora, who looked like he had adapted to this world, gave a wry smile to his
little sister who was in a deep sleep and showed that comfortable expression.
"Indeed, the degree of flexibility in my mind can't match up to hers......"
—'Tok Tok!'
Hearing the gentle knocking sound again, Sora replied.
"Ah- coming, coming. Who is it?"
"I am Stephanie Dora. I have something I would like to ask you regarding the
thing about today....."
........Stephanie.......Ah!
Taking out his phone, Sora confirmed the photos that were taken before.
What was shown on the photo was someone with red hair and blue eyes,
similar to a noble girl.
Yes, the pub downstairs— was also a venue for games to elect a new king.
"Ah, coming, I am opening the door."
".......Miwuuuuu...."
"—My little sister, it is a brother's blessing for you to stick to me like that, but
could you let go of my arm for a while? Otherwise I can't open the door."
".......?.......What?"
Although Shiro was in a half-asleep state, she still let go of Sora's arm.
Dragging his heavy body off of the bed, Sora stepped onto the wooden floors
that creaked and proceeded to open the door.
Appearing at the door was an appearance that was a far cry from the photo
on the phone— A [Stephanie] that looked like she had suffered a huge blow.
"—Can you let me in?"
"Ah. Ermm, okay."
In short, Stephanie was then invited into the room.
Sora then retrieved the chair from the corner of the room.
He then sat on the chair because his little sister who was sleeping drowsily on
the bed kept shifting positions.
The first to open her mouth was Stephanie.
"..........What exactly happened?"
"—What? Ah, let me start first, because we are siblings, this is not what—"
"....Guu......dumped, by Nii......"
—Correction.
Apparently not half asleep— but Shiro who was 80% in sleep mode applied
more pressure onto Sora's back.
Although they did not know what the common sense was like here, a tentative
explanation was still needed.
"Then— is it wrong? I'm Sora. The years I've been without a girlfriend equals
my age, and I'm currently seeking a girlfriend right now, whoa♪"
".............That doesn't really matter at all."
But Stephanie completely ignored the meaning of this sentence and feebly
continued.
"More importantly, I want to ask about something that happened during the
day."
(Day— day. Un, what was that again?)
(Speaking of which, what's the time now? I can't even see the sun coming
through the windows—)
Taking a glance at the phone, he saw that 4 hours had passed since the start
of the rest— They had probably been sleeping for this long.
"Today, right when you had brushed past my shoulders, you said to me
something like 'Can't you see you are being cheated?'."
Just when Shiro was grumbling vague nonsense, probably something about
the current conversation, she closed her eyes and spoke.
".......So you.......really lost?"
Stephanie seemed to be agitated by Shiro's attitude.
"—Yes.........yes, that's right, I LOST! Now, just about everything is over!"
Sora covered his ears to muffle the shouting coming from Stephanie, who had
abruptly stood up.
"Ah— because of my lack of sleep, the sound will echo back and forth in my
head, so please refrain from shouting so loudly........."
Towards Stephanie who threw a heated temper tantrum that included banging
the table with her purse, Sora made only a small and humble request, but
evidently it didn't pass her ears, and she started crying with an even sharper
voice.
"Since you knew that the opponent was cheating, wouldn't it have been good
for me if you had explained the cheat to everyone?! I could have won if you
had exposed the truth!"
Sora then remembered what he had read before going to sleep, and said.
"Eh........ number eight of the [Ten Oaths]: if cheating is detected during a
game, it will be regarded as a defeat..."
Which is to say, you win if you clearly know that you are being cheated.
But she failed to realize— if it cannot be proved, the person cheating wouldn't
be defeated.
"I lost, thanks to you! Arghhh, now I am even eliminated from the competition
for the throne!"
"......So..........."
The drowsy Shiro spoke with a lisp.
".......So you lost.........and were in denial.............so you came here.........to
vent?"
Hearing Shiro's blunt and unabashed opinion, the blood pressure that spiked
as a result forced Stephanie to grind her teeth.
"Ah~my little sister, can we not pour oil on the fire while pretending to be
asleep?"
"...........Guu........why did..........you reveal that?"
"You woke up after I said [Looking for girlfriend]............furthermore, we
don't really have any companions here, sooo, we really should be more
friendly—"
—But.
Sora suddenly stopped speaking.
An idea— surfaced in his mind.
Probably seeing the idea forming in her brother's mind, Shiro became silent.
On the other hand, Sora, who seemed like he had changed his mind, said with
a sardonic smile.
"—But, what my little sister said was also true. Humans who always fail are
taken for granted."
"........What did you say?"
The shocked Stephanie's mouth gaped.
But Sora disregarded her shock, and deliberately using vulgar eyes, looked
up and down Stephanie's body.
Just like a fantasy world Ojou-sama, she wore a fluttering dress that had lace
everywhere.
Sora's eyes seemed to be licking her body, observing her voluminous figure
that couldn't be hidden even if she wore a dress.
Carefully selecting words that would set off the opponent— Sora said.
"Not even being able to see through cheating of that degree, and then
suddenly running here to have a tantrum..........you're even getting angry at a
child hitting the nail— you really are a simpleton. And if you are really the
lineage of that foolish old king, then I suppose failing would be something
natural for you."
Part 8
Sora said this with eyes that were filled with a pity reserved for extremely
unintelligent organisms.
Widening her eyes, trembling while directing a burning death glare towards
Sora, another furious expression emerged on Stephanie's face.
"Please........take that back."
"Take it back? Haha, why?"
"Be that as it may— I definitely won't allow you to ridicule my dear Ojii-san!"
Facing against Stephanie's solemn protesting, Sora only scoffed and waved
his hands.
"The reason why you didn't notice that cheat was because you were too
defensive— rather than taking risks, you tried to choose a safer way to win.
These kind of people concentrate too much on securing themselves that they
don't even have the spare capacity to pay attention to the opponent's actions."
He gave a sarcastic smile while tossing out these cheeky words.
"A simpleton with a low boiling point that can't even control your own
emotions because you're so conservative. IMHO[11], that is simply out of the
question for a gamer!"
"—Be quiet, if I wanted your opinion, then—"
Preventing his escape from the chair, Stephanie was in a posture like she was
ready to grab hold of Sora, but Sora still continued to speak.
"Then, let's play a game."
"......Eh? What?"
Stephanie was suddenly confused. But she remained vigilant and questioned
Sora about what he had just said.
"Nothing, it doesn't really require any complex thinking. It's just rock, paper,
scissors. Heard of it? Rock, paper, scissors."
"Rock, paper, scissors—? That.....un, I know."
"Un, this world is indeed a great help. Then we will use that to determine the
winner, just that—"
Saying that, Sora put up his fingers.
As if saying it carefully for Stephanie to hear, Sora slowly continued.
"Not ordinary janken— do you understand? I will only use paper."
"—Ah?"
"If I were to throw anything other than paper, then I would [Lose]........but, if
I beat you with something other than paper, you will also lose, leading to a
[Draw]. Of course, if I throw out anything other than paper and I draw, then I
will still [Lose]."
"—"
(Losing if it isn't paper? What does this guy think he's saying?)
Stephanie became more alert.
"—The wager, what will it be?"
It was such a big help of you to be so sensible— Sora thought about saying
this, then smiled and replied.
"If you win, I will accept all of your requests. Whether you want me to tell
you the reason you lost, or the truth behind that cheat, or even if you want me
to die in repayment for calling your foolish king a foolish king, it doesn't
matter."
"......Youuuuu!"
"—So! Conversely, if I win, you must accept all of my demands."
Sora looked happy, but he had on an expression that was colder than ice,
with a creepy smile that had emerged.
Using a tone that was dirty, ugly, and cold, Sora continued speaking.
"We are betting our fates here— so it's not a problem for you to wager your
chastity, right?"
All of the hot blood gushing into Stephanie's head was calmed down due to
this coldness.
But, because Stephanie's mind had calmed down, she prudently questioned.
"What if— we draw?"
"Then I will give you a little hint on how you were cheated......as
consideration."
Sora's attitude suddenly changed, and as if troubled, scratched his head and
said with a smile.
"I can make do with a trivial wish. Although what we have on hand seems like
it'll last us a few days— I'll be straightforward, after four days of staying here,
we'll have no food or place to stay. And in the long run, we are still worrying
about what to do next......."
"—Which means, you want me to provide you with accommodations."
Towards Stephanie's reply, Sora only returned a smile..
—Nothing was said.
Which means that this man was temporarily trying to scrounge a little bit.
"So, how do you feel~? Accept, or deny?"
"........"
"Well, even if you learn how the opponent cheated, you are already
disqualified from the throne selection. Not to mention that there is no benefit
to taking an unnecessary risk if you are someone who loves a defensive war!
So even if you refuse it's nothing."
Sora brazenly provoked her.
Despite it being such a blatant provocation— Stephanie still accepted it
without flinching.
".......Okay, let's do this then— 【Acciente】!!!"
—That was an oath to make sure the game followed the [Ten Oaths].
A word that declares full intention to God to perform a wager in absolute
compliance to the [Ten Oaths]— swearing to God, the absolute requirement
when gambling.
"OK, then I shall also- 【Acciente】."
Sora gave a leering smile— that vow from his mouth was both unpredictable
and askew.
In Stephanie's mind, she began thinking intensely.
(—Only throw out paper?)
(Unless he thinks that I would cheerfully throw out scissors.)
(Looking at the conditions he suggested— his intentions are obvious.)
(The goal of that man— is to reach a tie.)
(This man is only trying to get food and accommodation— he doesn't really
understand the cheat.)
(This should not be the truth now.)
(If he would lose if he doesn't use paper, then my chances of winning are—)
Rock: 2 wins, 1 loss. Scissors: 2 wins, 1 draw. Paper: 1 win, 2 draws.
(He announced that he wouldn't choose anything other than paper.)
(If I innocently sent out scissors, he would choose rock.)
(He plans on mocking me by saying "Haha, just as I expected~ It was hard
on you, you single-celled idiot".)
(But if that was so, if I used paper— it would be impossible for me to lose.)
(But it would still fulfill his goals if the result was a draw.)
(—This man, definitely thinks that I won't use rock—.)
(Because, that's the only choice that I have with a possibility of losing!)
(—Treating me like an idiot!)
(Both rock and scissors are good, my chances of winning are [2:1])
(Thinking as you wish— I will not let you get away with a draw!)
Trying to penetrate through Sora, Stephanie stared at him with sharp eyes.
"——"
—However, Stephanie, who looked at Sora's expression, could not help but
take a deep breath.
Because there was a skinny man that was troublesome— or not.
Calmly, the man that was confident that he would win revealed a faint smile.
Seeing Sora's expression— blood rushed into Stephanie's head once again,
as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on her.
(—No, don't be impetuous, keep calm.)
Finishing those words in her head, Stephanie started brainstorming again.
Rashness, emotions and simplicity- what if he sees through all of these?
Stephanie said to herself and noticed something.
—Right.
This, of course, was an obvious matter.
(This guy—this man—declared that paper was the only exception!)
(In addition, no matter what other method he uses, he can not [Win].)
(So— no matter what I choose, this man only announced that he would
choose [Paper].......)
(Victory would come to him if he happens to get a lucky draw and a tie
would be expected— that's right!)
(The possibility of losing— is the same no matter what!)
"Then, should we start?"
Sora asked with the air of winner— but.
"Yeah, you too. Are you prepared to comply to the Oaths?"
Likewise, Stephanie who believed that she would win, replied.
(I have already seen through your tricks— go on and put on the expression of
a lost dog[12]!)
"Then let's begin. Ready- rock, paper...—"
—Rock.
Stephanie had used [Scissors].
"What—"
—Widening her eyes because Sora had chosen [Rock].
"Whu, What— Wh, Why.......like this....."
"Although it is laudable that you honestly came out with rock and did not give
into the provocation— in the end you are still too inexperienced."
Saying that— the ruthless edge and thin smile disappeared from Sora's face.
Sora sat on the bed again, and lightly talked through the inner thought
processes of Stephanie to her.
"My provocation was to make rock appear to you as the only way you could
lose."
"........"
"—But my calm expression drove in an understanding that only by using
paper would I [Win]."
"—Wha......I was being read— So that expression.......was all an act!?"
"So far so good......But choosing [Paper] would have made me lose........this
way, not only would you defeat my only chance of winning, you could also
double your possibility of winning against me."
—Everything was seen through- no, everything was manipulated by him.
"Guuu—"
Stephanie bit her lips and knelt down with her hands supporting her body.
The calming down process.....not only that, but even the winning idea that
Stephanie had thought out was also predicted.
—Finally, this.
The reason why Stephanie lost during the day- this was the hint.
However, Sora continued.
"So, yeah, it was already decided that I would win from the outset of this
game."
"I know. You were aiming for a draw, right? Okay, what accommodations
—"
Stephanie who had lost casually replied- but.
"Well, about that right there. You're wrong, you know?"
".......Ah?"
"Try re~ally hard to recall it, okay? How did I say it?"
"I can make do with a trivial wish. Although what we have on hand seems like
it'll last us a few days— I'll be straightforward, after four days of staying here,
we'll have no food or place to stay. And in the long run, we are still worrying
about what to do next......."
"Right, there's a problem here! When...did I ever say what the specific
contents of my [Trivial wish] were?"
"...................Ah!?"
Stephanie hurriedly got up and protested.
"Eh, because, didn't you already affirm that you only required
accommodation!?"
"Un, but I didn't confirm it~"
Stephanie tried to recall what had happened like a video playback with
sound, fully utilizing her mind.
With no place to stay, no food, how did he conceal the next words.
Sora—this man—had only....
Smiled.
—So the reason for his wishful thinking was to scrounge for more—
"Ah—ah—"
"Looks like you understand! Then please listen carefully to my [Trivial wish]♪"
With Sora wearing a smile, 'Sha'— he suddenly pointed his finger towards
Stephanie.
"Fall in love with me!"
Part 9
………………—
.......A long silence.
The first to break the awkwardness, the one who was always silent, was
Shiro who watched innocently from the sidelines.
".......Erm, Nii?"
"Hehehe, what is it, my little sister. Was my plan so perfect that it moved you
to speechlessness?"
Although he could not understand his little sister's intentions, Sora was already
intoxicated with his perfect command.
【6】 "As per the Oath", the wager will be unconditionally adhered to.
Also considering the case of the ninth Oath— because of God's power, the
order couldn't be stopped by anything.
Well, of course, that also includes the individual's free will!
But—
"........That.........is..........what is going on..........?"
Facing against his little sister who was simply clueless, Sora also made an
expression as if he did not understand anything.
"Oya, it really is surprising that you don't understand, my little sister. Isn't
there a saying that 'love is blind'? If it is in absolute compliance with the
Oaths, then of course she would have to completely [Dedicate herself] to me,
right? Accommodation, money, even talent can be gained...isn't this killing
three birds with one stone♪"
Sora said it like this, wondering why she couldn't understand even though she
had such a good mind.
Shiro muttered softly.
"......."Become my property".......wouldn't that........do?"
"———Nn?"
".........For that........you.........get everything."
"—Eh, ah.....ehhhh?"
Sora was confused for an instant. After that he started accelerating his
thinking process.
If it was just as his little sister had said, the command of [Become my
property]...
Everything that belongs to a property naturally belongs to its master—
"Ah, eh? Wouldn't that kind of way be much more favorable.......huh?"
(Why didn't I think of that——?)
Shouldn't he have said that.
Planning policies had always been thought out by himself since the beginning,
so why would Sora, who claimed that he had the performance and strength,
do that—
"...............Nii......your own wish..........was mixed inside?"
"——Ahhhh......."
Shiro— gazed coldly at him with half-closed eyes, and not because she was
still drowsy.
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
Sora cried and hugged his head.
"I, I actually.........turned out to be like this!? Was it about that- if I missed this
chance, I'll never get a girlfriend?! Did the superficial sense of inferiority of not
having a girlfriend cloud my judgement at the last minute!? No,
im...impossible......how could I, I make such a silly mistake—"
Impossible.
For one of the wings of 『　　』 to commit such a mistake— Sora felt dizzy.
As if she was unhappy with something, Shiro continued to say with her cold
voice.
"......Nii.........you said you had......no need for a girlfriend.................that as
long as Shiro was here.......that would be good enough............"
"That was me saying too much! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I am so sorry,
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
With his little sister pouting on the bed, Sora knelt in front of her as if in a
devout kind of worship and apologized.
"Af, after all I am unable to do those kind of things to my little sister! You are
only 11 years old! If I did it, I would be taken away by the cops! And with
your brother of age, this sort of desire is natural—"
Sora who was chattering all kinds of excuses. And Shiro who was staring
with cold eyes.
Furthermore,
"—"
After being requested to fall in love, Stephanie was thrown aside and had her
head lowered while trembling.
Yes. Just as Sora had thought, there could be absolutely no refusal to the
Oaths. Which was this world's absolute law.
But— her cheeks were burning, and the rapid beating of her heart could not
be stopped.
Because Sora had ignored her to talk to his little sister, Stephanie felt worried.
—Even if this was the law of this world.
No.
Because of this man.
Because of this guy.
—She actually— "felt jealous"—!
"How can I acknowledge thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis!"
"Whoa, that scared me!"
With the force built up from her anger, Stephanie finally shrieked out.
Intending to resist the implanted feelings, she glared at Sora— but.
"—Wh, whoaa!"
When their eyes met, her heartbeat suddenly quickened and her face became
hotter.
"Wh, wha, what what what kind of [Trivial wish] was that! You, you dare toy
with a maiden's heart!?"
To try and avoid this effect, Stephanie changed her line of sight and shouted.
Despite standing up aggressively, she still lacked a bit of momentum.
"Ah, that........about that......."
Sora scratched his cheeks, and shifted away his eyes with an embarrassed
look on his face.
He had originally wanted a development to happen, but due to his huge
mistake, some of his goals were not achieved and Sora could not help but be
worried.
"That, about that, Shiro? What do I do?"
"........I.....don't know....."
"Guuuuuu......"
Losing face and seeking help from his little sister, only to be coldly cast aside
—
"What a pain— *cough*!"
No matter. Sora, who had finally made up his mind, coughed.
He decided to treat the mistake as if it did not even happen.
Sora, feeling good again, could not help but giggle.
"The definition of trivial depends on the person. You only wanted one bite of
the dessert, but that one bite was the whole thing[13]..."
Probably back to his normal state, Sora fluently said this.
"Isn't, isn't that a fraud!"
But, Stephanie didn't accept his form of interpretation and strongly rebutted.
—The voice of Sora that flowed into her ears made her feel embarrassed.
Even though she really hoped that he would close his mouth, the problem was
that she actually wanted to listen to his voice.
Using a [Request for an explanation] as an excuse to try and do this, she
repressed the entanglement in her heart and retorted.
With absolutely no idea of how to deal with the kind of feelings entangling in
Stephanie's heart(nor any reason to), Sora (eighteen years old, virgin) calmed
down.
And as if pointing out a childish mistake, he pointed to Stephanie.
"Yup, right there. You were paying attention to the content of the game, yet
you ignored the [Premise] of it. That won't do, without any specific nature of
this statement........for example, even if an alarmist emphasizes on hearing the
winning conditions, sometimes their focus will deliberately get fuzzed up, get
it~"
—After all, the purpose of this game was to have a draw.
That was what Stephanie had thought so far.
But that was still not enough, there were still parts that weren't thought of.
Whether he won or drew— Stephanie's risks were the same.
This was the true point of the game— which is to say—
"You, you— swindler!"
Yes, the so-called [Fraud].
There was indeed a reason for why Stephanie had shouted— however.
"Oioi, saying that is too over the top~ obviously it was the fault of the one
being cheated~"
"Th, these are the lines of a swindler!"
Facing against Stephanie, whose protests were never ending, the clamor
finally drove Shiro to speak.
"........Of the [Ten Oaths].....Three......In games....... wagers will be made on
what both parties decide to be of equal value."
Because Shiro finally changed back, Sora ecstatically continued.
"Yes! The main point is 'to be of equal value'. After that, four: unless contrary
to "Three", the game content and the things wagered do not matter— which is
to say?"
Moving her fingers around, Shiro answered.
".......Life.......and human rights........can be wagered......."
"Yes, exactly♪ Which means that when the bet was decided, the game had
already begun."
As if explaining to Stephanie, only the conversation between the siblings could
be heard.
Shiro then said.
"..........But........it wasn't necessary..........to even wager feelings."
"That's not it! This was to confirm if even free will and resistance could be
dominated over—"
".......Nii."
"Sorry."
It appeared that the effect of 'treating the mistake like it never happened' did
not work on his little sister.
"But, but—! Using this kind of fraud—!"
With fraud, forcing her first love to be—
Stephanie, who rebutted in tears, originally wanted to raise cruel accusations.
But-
"........Sixth of the [Ten Oaths].......the wager.........will be unconditionally
adhered to......."
The eleven-year old girl— with eyes filled with compassion and calmness,
issued the final blow.
"...........Easily forgetting the weight of the premise.........falling to the
provocation......that was all you."
—Yes, the Ten Oaths had to be followed.
【5】 The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the game.
Stephanie had the right to refuse the game, and also the right to change its
content.
The one who wasted those rights, submissively offered a wager, and
accepted the game was not anybody else—
"—Guuu....."
—It was Stephanie herself.
Perhaps having nothing else to say, Stephanie planted her rear end on the
ground.
In fact, the Oaths that were set up— were currently influencing Stephanie.
These Oaths were legitimately recognized by the world of this game.
No matter what Stephanie said, she had already lost, and the bet had been
established.
"Then, I guess you have accepted it, Stephanie?"
"—Guuu.......you.....!"
Rubbish! Was what she had intended to add on.
—But her feelings did not allow her to do so.
Not only that, a sweet feeling went into her heart just by being called by her
name—
"—Guu— why is this happening, agghhhhhhhhhhh!"
With a fire that couldn't be released, Stephanie got into a kneeling posture
and used her head to repeatedly bang the ground.
"Whoa— are, are you alright!?"
"How do I look alright to you!?"
Trying to ignore the pain of her slowly swelling forehead, Stephanie glared at
Sora, which made him cringe. However.
"No, not at all. B-but I did win the bet, so— can I make a request?"
Request—
Yes...after all, Sora's motive was not for her to fall in love with him, but for
the things that resulted from that.
Stephanie then remembered what he had said earlier, that love would lead to
her dedication.
However— hold on, Stephanie.
Sora's request was to 'fall in love with him'.
But not to 'follow his orders', right?
In other words, Stephanie had no obligation to accept any of his requests.
"Well......hehehe, looks like you had a miscalculation......."
Understanding this, then everything was very simple.
No matter what requests were put forward, just answer [NO!] and
everything would be settled.
Doesn't that solve everything!
"Okay. First of all, because Stephanie is too long, can I shorten it to Steph
instead?"
"Hmmm? Ah, okay, no problem at all♪— ahh!"
—Gaining a new nickname, [Steph] smiled and nodded.
The rationality and resolution to [Reject everything] two seconds ago had
completely disappeared.
The maiden who had turned simple due to love and would inevitably blush
when getting called by a nickname—
"Nu—noo, nam..name, there is nooo.....need to be worried.....about
call....calling me by a nickname......! Names don't matter! Un un, just like that,
un! Then after that I'll be fine if I just don't accept any other requests!"
But Steph who constrained herself to agree did not realize.
As long as she hurriedly escaped from this room, nothing else would happen.
Which is to say— she unconsciously had a desire to stay by Sora's side.....
"Un, well, it would be great if you could call me Sora. Steph, you are of royal
lineage, right?"
—Here it comes.
Right, if the motive was support, then he'll demand money, accommodation
and food.
He would do this in order to get those things.
However, these requests that were going to be made, did not bind Steph to
comply to his demands.
Hehe, Steph laughed in her heart.
If Sora requested, she would bluntly reply with a 'I refuse!'.
Let this swindler have a feeling of defeat— and his expression would be
worth watching at that time.
With her corresponding lines ready, Steph waited for Sora's request.
"In that case, your house must be very spacious. Can we stay with you for a
while?"
"—Ah, okay, no problem❤"
—…… ..
Eh?
"Eh, ehhhh? Why? Hmm?"
Steph fell into disarray because she did not understand what she had just said.
However, her face had such a fiery feeling that she was going to have a
nosebleed, which then prompted Steph to think back to Sora's words.
'Can we stay with you'—
That means staying together.
Cohabitation......which means a man and a woman living together.
Being able to stay together.
Which means......along with the bed, the bathroom and the like could be
shared—
"Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, not right! This is not right! It's not that
way!"
Watching Steph continuously headbutting the wooden wall with a 'Dong Dong
Dong'- Sora, who was scared pale, asked.
"Uh, umm, how do I say this...even though the situation has become very
strange...........is it okay?"
"How could this do!— ahhh.............everything is already useless........"
Steph faced the ceiling and gave a hollow laugh.
—Yup, Sora did commit a huge mistake.
Presenting requests without any [Contractually obligation].
But Sora's age equals how long he's been without a girlfriend.
He can't understand Steph because she is experiencing her first love.
Historically, love has been one of the reasons countries have fallen to ruin.
—This is just too contemptuous.
